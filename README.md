# Proxies
  Make sure you use only premium proxy if any suggestions or upgrade in code plz make sure to open issue or contribute
  Use of premium proxy is must and dont even try to use freemium it will lead into an premanent account ban on shorterner services


* ## Free Proxy
   Ohh hell nah this is prohibited
   
* ## Premium Proxy
   Make sure you buy a auto replacement if you can while buying proxy so it can help it make seem more real devices

* ## Rotating Proxy
   And this is what I use personally if have any suggestion let me know in issues or contribute

 # Best Practices
  To get the most out of this script you should maintain these things.
  * In a nutshell, you need Rotating proxies to get the best result.
  Nothing else
  * make sure you dont add too many threads or its gonna not load and quit itself if anyone can fix do a pull request
  * if you can change some things in fake_useragent module for the best result

  Thanks and plz donate to keep this project up and running
